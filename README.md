The Raspberry Pi 2 board does not have a built-in analog to digital converter so to interface analog sensors and actuators external components must be used. In this example a parallel 8 bit ADC is used (TLC0820).

Program is executed in terminal and has two progress bars to indicate position of the XY joystick.
